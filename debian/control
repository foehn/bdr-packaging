Description: PostgreSQL C client library
 libpq is a C library that enables user programs to communicate with
 the PostgreSQL database server.  The server can be on another machine
 and accessed through TCP/IP.  This version of libpq is compatible
 with servers from PostgreSQL 8.2 or later.
 .
 This package contains the run-time library, needed by packages using
 libpq.

Description: object-relational SQL database, version 9.4 server
 PostgreSQL is a fully featured object-relational database management
 system.  It supports a large part of the SQL standard and is designed
 to be extensible by users in many aspects.  Some of the features are:
 ACID transactions, foreign keys, views, sequences, subqueries,
 triggers, user-defined types and functions, outer joins, multiversion
 concurrency control.  Graphical user interfaces and bindings for many
 programming languages are available as well.
 .
 This package provides the database server for PostgreSQL-BDR 9.4. Servers
 for other major release versions can be installed simultaneously and
 are coordinated by the postgresql-common package. A package providing
 ident-server is needed if you want to authenticate remote connections
 with identd.

 This is the client package for PostgreSQL-BDR 9.4. If you install
 PostgreSQL-BDR 9.4 on a standalone machine, you need the server package
 postgresql-9.4, too. On a network, you can install this package on
 many client machines, while the server package may be installed on
 only one machine.
